```
Simple factory delegates object creation to a different class. The class calling the factory does not care about the implementation details annd works on the interface.
```

```
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creatiing an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass
```

Basic OO principles covered

- **Encapsulate what varies.**.
All factory patterns encapsulate object creation. Factory method pattern encapsulates object creation by letting subclasses decide what objects to create.
- **Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.**
